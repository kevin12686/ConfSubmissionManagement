# Architecture Notes

Conference Final Manager is a local Django application with SQLite storage and local file management. The application is intentionally no-login and single-machine.

## Application Boundaries

- Controllers handle HTTP forms, redirects, Django messages, downloads, and template rendering.
- Application selectors assemble read-only page contexts and query composition.
- Application commands wrap state-changing workflows and return result objects.
- Services contain domain logic for imports, verification, PDF processing, formatting, title/author extraction, CrossCheck/plagiarism integration, exceptions, reports, storage cleanup, and backup/restore.
- Templates stay simple Bootstrap pages; there is no React or separate frontend build.

Core route groups:

- `/papers/`: Paper Master List.
- `/submissions/`: Final Submissions and Editor Upload.
- `/reviews/`: Paper ID, title/author, formatting, exceptions, and Not Publishing workflows.
- `/processing/pdfs/`: page count, hashes, thumbnails, active-final copies, and old-version copies.
- `/reports/`: readiness reports, author count, version history, and publication exports.
- `/integrations/crosscheck/`: CrossCheck/plagiarism package export/import and System State Backup/Restore.
- `/settings/`: app settings, active-version rule preview, storage management, and clear database.

## FinalSubmission State Split

`FinalSubmission` remains the compatibility record and behavior source of truth. Newer one-to-one state models mirror lifecycle domains:

- `FinalSubmissionIdentityState`
- `FinalSubmissionFileState`
- `FinalSubmissionReviewState`
- `FinalSubmissionPublicationState`
- `FinalSubmissionPlagiarismState`

The split supports gradual refactoring. Reads can move to state models one workflow at a time, but writes must stay synchronized until legacy fields are fully retired.

## Workflow Rules

- Paper Master List is the publication scope.
- Final Submissions can come from Start2 imports or Editor Uploads.
- Editor Uploads are prioritized over Start2 records, but unresolved Start2/Editor conflicts block final publication export until one side is discarded.
- Discard is version-level: it excludes one Final Submission version but does not mean the paper is not publishing.
- Not Publishing is paper/publication-decision-level: it keeps records for traceability but excludes the paper from publication readiness and package output.
- Publication PDF priority is corrected PDF, then active-final processed PDF, then original author PDF.
- Publication source priority is corrected source, then original source/current source.
- Active version selection is previewed before changing the active-version rule in Settings.
- Import/re-upload workflows are preview-before-apply when they may change existing records or files.
- Review flags are reset only when dependent data changes.

## File And Path Safety

Managed files live under the project `data/` tree by default. Database fields may store file paths, but System State export/restore must remap managed paths into the receiving project folder.

Do not preserve machine-specific absolute paths in restored state. Snapshot manifests may include portable path references and hashes, but restore must reject corrupted or unsupported archives.

Storage cleanup is split by risk:

- Conservative cleanup removes unreferenced regenerated cache and orphaned active/old output.
- Generated reports/exports cleanup removes regenerated Excel/ZIP downloads and external upload packages.
- Original uploads, corrected uploads, plagiarism report PDFs, system state backups, and referenced thumbnails/previews are retained.

## Versioning

The app version is defined in `conference_final_manager/settings.py` as `APP_VERSION`.

The System State archive format is defined separately as `STATE_ARCHIVE_VERSION`. Increment the archive version only when backup/restore structure or compatibility changes. Increment the app version for user-visible behavior, workflow, docs, or schema changes.

The footer displays both values so a user can match a System State ZIP to the expected application version.

## Regression Gate

Run these checks before merging or handing off changes:

```bash
.venv/bin/python manage.py check
.venv/bin/python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run
.venv/bin/python manage.py test submissions
.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q submissions conference_final_manager manage.py
```

For documentation-only changes, `check` and `makemigrations --check --dry-run` are usually enough, plus a link/stale-term review.
